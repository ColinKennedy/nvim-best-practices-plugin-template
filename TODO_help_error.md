- When the user types incorrect text they should

- See an example of what is allowed input
- If the argument they typed is incorrect (and we can verify it because the argument has `choices` defined), list the allowed choices. Cut off the text after a certain amount so it doesn't overwhelm their screen

- Make sure that expressions don't accidentally trigger validtion failure if the expression evaluates into valid input
